# Plainion.CI

Provides tools for build automation and continuous integration

## Motivation

Nowadays continuous delivery is a must for every project. Short cycle times for new features and 
bug fixes - from code change till a new release is published - are important. Automation is the key.

Also there are many really good continuous intergration and delivery solutions already out there - 
if you are like me and have several one-man projects most existing solutions seem to be overkill.

This project puts the focus on simplicity. It aims to reduce the work to publish a new release of
your project to the push of a button.

Of course simplicitly comes with reduced flexibility. If your project grows, if the number of contributors
increases I encourage you to switch to one of the "bigger solutions" out there.

## Usage

* specify package creation and deployment scripts relative to project root
