Do you also want to have "continuous delivery" for your hobby project? 
Short cycle times? Fully automated?
But the established solutions seem to be overkill for your one-man project?

Try out Plainion.CI - your personal "micro deployment pipeline"!

![](Overview.png)

## Usage

Get your personal pipeline up and running in less then 5 minutes. Follow the [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md).

See how I use the tool on the [Examples page](Examples.md).

## Installation

- download the [latest release](https://github.com/plainionist/Plainion.CI/releases) and unpack it somewhere
- start the Plainion.CI.exe
